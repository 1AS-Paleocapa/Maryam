      In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
      I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
      And I watch from a distance seventeen
      And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
      It's not what you painted in my head
      There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

      We all are living in a dream
      But life ain't what it seems
      Oh everything's a mess
      And all these sorrows I have seen
      They lead me to believe
      That everything's a mess

      But I wanna dream
      I wanna dream
      Leave me to dream
      In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
      Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
      And the cries from the strangers out at night
      They don't keep us up at night
      We have the curtains drawn and closed
      We all are living in a dream
      But life ain't what it seems
      Oh everything's a mess
      And all these sorrows I have seen
      They lead me to believe
      That everything's a mess
